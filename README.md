# [Introduction to the Basic Node and Express Challenges](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/basic-node-and-express/)

# Basic Node and Express :symbols:

This project is part of the FreeCodeCamp's Back End Development and APIs studies.


## Functionality :heavy_check_mark:

-  Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to write backend (server-side) programs in JavaScript. Node.js comes with a handful of built-in modules — small, independent programs — that help with this. Some of the core modules include HTTP, which acts like a server, and File System, a module to read and modify files.

- In the last set of courses you learned to install and manage packages from npm, which are collections of smaller modules. These packages can help you build larger, more complex applications.

- Express is a lightweight web application framework, and is one of the most popular packages on npm. Express makes it much easier to create a server and handle routing for your application, which handles things like direct people to the correct page when they visit a certain endpoint like `/blog`.

- In this course, you'll learn the basics of Node and Express including how to create a server, serve different files, and handle different requests from the browser.

## How To Run FCC Tests locally :arrow_forward:

- Has [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) (and optionally [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)) installed and updated on your machine;

- Clone (`$ git clone git@github.com:filipy94/basic-node-and-express.git`) or donwload this repository;

- Navigate to project root;

- Install the dependencies with `$ npm install` or `$ yarn install`;

- Execute the project with `$ npm start` or `$ yarn start`;

- Manually open the browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.
